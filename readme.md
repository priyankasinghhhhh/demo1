# Copilot Experience Documentation

## What code did Copilot generate?

Copilot generated a script (please specify the filename, e.g., `main.py` or `script.js`) that accomplished the following:
- [Briefly describe the functionality, e.g., "Automates data processing from CSV files" or "Implements a simple REST API."]

## Did you modify the script?

Yes/No (choose one and elaborate below):

- **If modified:**  
  I made the following changes to the Copilot-generated code:
  - [Describe modifications, e.g., "Fixed a bug in the file path handling."]
  - [Improved error handling for edge cases.]
  - [Added comments and documentation.]

- **Reason for modification:**  
  [Explain why you modified the code, e.g., "To ensure compatibility with my data format," or "To improve readability and maintainability."]

## How did you test it?

- I tested the script by:
  - [Describe your testing process, e.g., "Running it with sample input files."]
  - [Using different scenarios to check for robustness.]
  - [Reviewing Copilot's suggestions and verifying correctness.]

- Results:
  - [Summarize test outcomes, e.g., "The script produced correct output in all tested cases," or "I encountered one minor issue, which I fixed."]

## How to run the script

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Example for Python
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Example for Node.js
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   # Example for Python
   python main.py

   # Example for Node.js
   node script.js
   ```

3. **Provide input (if required):**
   - [Explain any input files or arguments needed, e.g., "Place your CSV files in the `data/` folder."]

4. **Check results:**
   - [Describe where to find output or logs.]
